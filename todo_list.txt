 Ultimate To-Do List for OpenAI Agents SDK Level 1 Quiz

🧠 1. Core Concepts of the OpenAI Agents SDK 
🔹 General Philosophy
Python-first design for orchestration 

SDK's purpose in managing agent loops and tool calls 

🔹 Agent Components
Agents: 
    Purpose and structure 

Tools: 
    Usage, 
    structure(name, description, params_json_schema, on_invoked_tool, strict_json_schema), 
    return types (LLM tak hamesha str ki format ma tool output jayega) 

Handoffs: 
    What they are and how they enable multi-agent collaboration??  

Context Objects: Managing and using context

🔹 Execution Flow
Agent Loop execution

Runner.run_sync() vs. streaming mode

Error handling in tool execution

Agent Cloning (reusing or modifying agent configuration)

🔹 Typed Inputs/Outputs
Pydantic Models for validation

JSON Schemas

Use of @tool decorator with Pydantic input models

🔹 Advanced Features
Dynamic instructions

Guardrails

Tracing

✍️ 2. Prompt Engineering
🔹 Prompt Techniques
